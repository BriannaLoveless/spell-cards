# TODO (What I want this app to do)
- Display all spells from D&D 5e in a "card"
    // Name, effect, range, conditions, maybe images? -- might require separate api or something?
- Create search functionality for users
- Have a way to "favorite" or save specific spells -- local storage, not w/ sign in
    // separate page? just down at the bottom, smaller maybe?
    // maybe separate "tab" within the page that hides the search section and displays all saved spells in a list/grid, maybe by level
